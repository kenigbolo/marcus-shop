## üì¶ Local Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kenigbolo/marcus-shop.git
   cd marcus-shop
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:

   - Copy `.env.example` or `.env.docker` to `.env` inside both the `store/` and `admin/` directories:

      - For runnning the app from the individual project folder
     ```bash
     cp store/.env.example store/.env
     cp admin/.env.example admin/.env
     ```

      - For runnning the app from docker via docker-compose
     ```bash
     cp store/.env.docker store/.env
     cp admin/.env.docker admin/.env
     ```

   - Fill in required variables (example below):
    
      - For running apps from individual folders i.e. `/admin` or `/store`
        ```env
        VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
        VITE_USER_ID=3f2c1de2-b879-4f0e-980f-16a48db451c7 # Store
        VITE_ADMIN_ID=3f2c1de2-b879-4f0e-980f-16a48db451c7 # Admin
        ```

      - For running apps from docker via docker-compose
        ```env
        VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://api:3000/api
        VITE_USER_ID=3f2c1de2-b879-4f0e-980f-16a48db451c7 # Store
        VITE_ADMIN_ID=3f2c1de2-b879-4f0e-980f-16a48db451c7 # Admin
        ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**:

   ```bash
   cd store && npm install
   cd ../admin && npm install
   ```

4. **(Optional)** If running Rails API directly without Docker:

   ```bash
   cd api
   bundle install
   rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
   ```

## üê≥ Docker Usage

From the project root, start everything with:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Services will be available on:

| Service       | URL                   |
|---------------|------------------------|
| React Store   | http://localhost:5173  |
| Vue Admin     | http://localhost:4173  |
| Rails API     | http://localhost:3000  |

To seed the Rails database via Docker:

```bash
docker-compose exec api rails db:reset db:seed
```

## üß™ Dev Notes

This repo uses the following tech:

- **React + Vite** for `store/`
- **Vue + Vite** for `admin/`
- **Rails 8 API-only** for backend

Data structure allows creating products ‚Üí parts ‚Üí part_options.

Cart logic handles part selection and price overrides based on conditions.
